/**
 * This interface provides class with the ability to process Ledger Transactions. 
 * 
 * If a transaction is adjusted the existing transaction must be reversed and a new transaction must be 
 * created at the same occured date but with current processing date. To make the adjustment requires 2
 * transactions the first to reverse and second to replace. 
 * 
 * The replacment is not linked to the original by any Foregin keys. Only link the original to the reverse adjustment.
 * As the replacement transaction have the same occured date if they are listed they will be grouped together.
 * 
 * Also need a seperate replacement transaction to allow a different  orgUnit/User/Voucher to be applied.
 * The Reversal transaction should have a different voucher number. 
 * 
 * Look at a example of a purchase that been adjusted we should see the following.
 * 
 * 1. Original sales transaction with a sales recepit voucher.
 * 2. A reversal transaction with a credit note voucher.
 * 3. A replacment transaction with a new sales recepit voucher.
 * 
 * Can we do a partial reversal? Yes you may the implementors will reverse the entire transaction unless you
 * provide own entries. 
 * 
 * Implementors should also implement the UnitOfWork Interface to allow control of a database transaction.
